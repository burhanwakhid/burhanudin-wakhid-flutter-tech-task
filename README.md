Apps for Lunch Recipes Suggestion

## Time Management
In average you might spend 2 hours to complete this task, but it's up to you how you manage your time
to accomplish at least the requirements.

## Assessment

Our assessment criteria will pay attention to:
- How the application is structured, and files are organised.
- Code quality (Clean code).
- The quality of test cases in your test suite.
- Interpretation of the problem.
- Use of `git`.
- Implementation and final execution.
- Commits, as this will allow us to understand some of the decisions you make throughout the process.

## User Story
As a User, I would like to get a set of recipes what I can have for lunch today based on the contents of my fridge so
that I can quickly decide what I'll be having.

__Acceptance Criteria__
- Given that I have started the app, I should input my preference lunch date, or it would be today date if it is empty
- Given that I have made a request to the `/ingredients` endpoint, I should receive a JSON response of the ingredients in my fridge.
- Given that I get the options of my ingredients, I should choose some ingredients to get the recipes.
- Given that an ingredient is past its `use-by` date (inclusive), I should not be able to choose that ingredient.
- Given that an ingredient is past its ​best-before​ date (inclusive), but is still within its ​use-by​ date (inclusive),
it should be placed at the bottom with the oldest (less fresh) last.
- Given that I have chosen some ingredients, I should request to the `/recipes` endpoint with
 `?ingredients=<title-1>,<title-2>,<title-n>` as a query parameter.
- Given that I get the result of the available recipes, I should see a list of the recipes as well as the ingredients
 to make per recipes.

__Additional Criteria__
- Fork this Flutter project as a base for your project.
- The application must have more than one screen and navigation.
- The application SHOULD contain unit / widget tests (e.g. using the flutter_test package).
- The application MUST be completed using an OOP approach.
- Any dependencies MUST be installed using dependency management tools (Pub for Flutter).
- Any installation, build steps, testing and usage instructions MUST be provided in a `README.md`
file in the root of the application. __Do not use a autogenerated file__

## Framework
Use the [__Flutter__](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab) framework.  

## API Endpoint
__Documentation__

https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9359572/SW17TFmK

__Mock Base URL__

https://a61d556b-57ca-423f-8706-2e8dec75d714.mock.pstmn.io

__Instruction__
1. Use `/ingredients` to get all of my ingredients on my fridge
2. Use `/recipes?ingredients=<title-1>,<title-n>` to get recipes based on the preferred ingredients title

__NOTES : This API is only a mock server to simulate the request and response body. So the result of the API does not
 affect your final result.__ 
 
## Submission
The application should be committed to a `public` repository on `GitHub` or `BitBucket` (`<lastname>-<firstname>-techtask-mobile`)
 and simply send us a link to the repository.
